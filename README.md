# chessbot

This repo contains the code to train a chessbot via Deep-Q-Learning (train.py) and a GUI chessboard to play against the trained bot (main.py) using pygame. 

The GUI looks like this:

It is the result of a challenge between my roomate and me. We tried to implement a Chessbot over the winterbreak, without looking at chess related papers/tutorials and without using any preimplemented chessbot or using public chess data. The only chess related resource we were allowed to use was https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html, a python chess module. 

My installed packes can be found in requirements.txt . The training was done on a Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro Chip without using the GPU.
